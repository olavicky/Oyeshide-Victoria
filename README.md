### 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm a data analyst with a background in Economics. My journey into data analysis started with a strong curiosity about how data shapes business outcomes. Since then, I’ve developed hands-on experience working with real datasets, building dashboards, and communicating insights that matter.

I enjoy diving deep into data to uncover patterns, visualize results, and support strategic decision-making.
